    "Our plots show a spike at hour 0 and hour 7. Hour 0 is illegitimate since its number of calls also include all the NaN values filled in by zeroes. Hour 7 on the other hand, is a legitimate spike in the data. The reason why hour 7 seems reasonable is that most burglars often commit robberies in the middle of the night, like around 2:00 AM (Hour 2). So hour 7, or 7:00 AM is the appropriate time for when a person wakes up, sees that they got robbed, and calls the police.\n",
